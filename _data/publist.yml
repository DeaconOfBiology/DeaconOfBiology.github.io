- title: "Subsurface microbial community structure shifts along the geological features of the Central American Volcanic Arc"
  image:
  description: We find shifts in community composition along the convergent margin, with communities in similar geological settings clustering together independently of the proximity of sample sites. Microbial community composition correlates with geological variables such as host rock type, maturity of hydrothermal fluid and slab depth along different segments of the CAVA. This reveals tight coupling between deep Earth processes and subsurface microbial activity, controlling community distribution, structure and composition along a convergent margin.

- title: "Targeting deeply-sourced seeps along the Central Volcanic Zone"
  image:
  description: We carried out a scientific expedition, sampling along a ~800 km convergent margin segment of the Andean Convergent Margin in the Central Volcanic Zone of northern Chile, between 17 °S and 24 °S, sampling fluids, gases and sediments, in an effort to understand interactions between microbiology, deeply-sourced fluids, the crust, and tectonic parameters. We collected samples from 38 different sites, representing a wide diversity of seep types in different geologic contexts. Here we report the field protocols and the descriptions of the sites and samples collected.

- title: "Complex organic matter degradation by secondary consumers in chemolithoautotrophy-based subsurface geothermal ecosystems"
  image:
  description: Microbial communities in terrestrial geothermal systems often contain chemolithoautotrophs with well-characterized distributions and metabolic capabilities. However, the extent to which organic matter produced by these chemolithoautotrophs supports heterotrophs remains largely unknown. Here we compared the abundance and activity of peptidases and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) that are predicted to be extracellular identified in metagenomic assemblies from 63 springs in the Central American and the Andean convergent margin (Argentinian backarc of the Central Volcanic Zone), as well as the plume-influenced spreading center in Iceland. All assemblies contain two orders of magnitude more peptidases than CAZymes, suggesting that the microorganisms more often use proteins for their carbon and/or nitrogen acquisition instead of complex sugars. The CAZy families in highest abundance are GH23 and CBM50, and the most abundant peptidase families are M23 and C26, all four of which degrade peptidoglycan found in bacterial cells. This implies that the heterotrophic community relies on autochthonous dead cell biomass, rather than allochthonous plant matter, for organic material. Enzymes involved in the degradation of cyanobacterial- and algal-derived compounds are in lower abundance at every site, with volcanic sites having more enzymes degrading cyanobacterial compounds and non-volcanic sites having more enzymes degrading algal compounds. Activity assays showed that many of these enzyme classes are active in these samples. High temperature sites (> 80°C) had similar extracellular carbon-degrading enzymes regardless of their province, suggesting a less well-developed population of secondary consumers at these sites, possibly connected with the limited extent of the subsurface biosphere in these high temperature sites. We conclude that in < 80°C springs, chemolithoautotrophic production supports heterotrophs capable of degrading a wide range of organic compounds that do not vary by geological province, even though the taxonomic and respiratory repertoire of chemolithoautotrophs and heterotrophs differ greatly across these regions.

- title: "Effect of tectonic processes on biosphere–geosphere feedbacks across a convergent margin"
  image: Nat_geosci.png
  description: By combining geochemistry, isotope measurements, metagenomic sequencing, network analysis, and modeling, we show in this paper that subsurface communities of chemolithoautotrophs in the Costa Rican forearc subsurface biosphere could sequester 1.4 × 109 to 1.4 × 1010 mol of carbon per year, which would decrease estimates of the total carbon delivered to the mantle by 2 to 22%. In addition, we show that tectonic processes influence the community composition observed at the surface, shining a light on an underappreciated geobiochemical phenomenon that drives the co-evolution of the biosphere and the geosphere.
